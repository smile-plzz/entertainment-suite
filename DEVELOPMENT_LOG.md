### Project Combination: `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` and `NowShowing`

**Objective:** Combine the `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` and `NowShowing` projects into a single, cohesive application called `EntertainmentSuite`.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create a new directory** for the combined project.
2.  **Use `NowShowing` as the base** due to its more advanced features (backend, build process, etc.).
3.  **Integrate the mood-based recommendation feature** from `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` into the `NowShowing` UI.
4.  **Merge the stylesheets** to create a consistent look and feel.
5.  **Combine the JavaScript logic**, routing all API calls through the existing `omdb-proxy.js` for security.
6.  **Remove redundant files** like `movie-details.html`, as the `NowShowing` modal will handle this functionality.

**Execution:**

*   Created the `EntertainmentSuite` directory.
*   Copied the contents of the `NowShowing` project into `EntertainmentSuite`.
*   Merged the `index.html` files, adding the mood selector and recommendation grid to the main page.
*   Combined the `style.css` files, adapting the styles from `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` to fit the `NowShowing` design.
*   Merged the JavaScript files, integrating the mood-based recommendation logic into `app.js`.
*   Copied the `config.json` file to the `EntertainmentSuite` directory.

### Refactoring `app.js` for `detail.html` Integration

**Objective:** Prepare `app.js` to work with a dedicated `detail.html` page for movie/show details and video playback, removing old modal logic and simplifying the main application file.

**Changes Made:**

*   **Removed old DOM element declarations:** Eliminated elements related to the previous video modal, theme toggle, hamburger menu, and old navigation links.
*   **Removed UI functions:** Deleted `openVideoModal`, `populateEpisodes`, `loadVideoForMovie`, `loadVideoForSelectedEpisode`, `closeVideoModal`, `handleModalTabKey`, `trapFocus`, `constructVideoUrl`, and `findMoviesByMood` from the `ui` object.
*   **Removed associated event listeners:** Cleaned up event listeners that were tied to the removed DOM elements and functions.
*   **Updated `createMovieCard`:** Modified the function to redirect to `detail.html` with the `imdbID` as a query parameter when a movie card is clicked.
*   **Simplified `init` function:** Removed theme-related logic and the `moodGenreMapping` fetch, as these will be handled elsewhere or are no longer needed in `app.js`'s scope.
