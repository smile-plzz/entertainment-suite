### UI/UX Refinements and Consistency Updates

**Objective:** Further refine UI/UX elements and ensure consistency across the application.

**Changes Made:**

*   **File Structure Alignment:**
    *   Ensured `index.html` and `style.css` are correctly located at the project root, serving as the unified main page and stylesheet.
*   **`app.js` UI Logic Streamlining:**
    *   Removed redundant video modal UI elements and associated JavaScript logic from `app.js`, centralizing video playback handling within `detail.js`.
    *   Cleaned up unused search input elements and their event listeners.
*   **`detail.js` UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Implemented `trapFocus` for the `trailerModal` to improve accessibility and keyboard navigation.
*   **`news.js` UI/UX Cleanup:**
    *   Removed unused category filtering UI elements and JavaScript logic, as there is no dedicated `news.html` page.
*   **Home Screen Carousel Integration:**
    *   Added necessary HTML container elements to `index.html` to enable rendering of carousels from `carousels.js` on the home screen.
    *   Updated `carousels.js` to redirect to `detail.html` upon movie card click, aligning with the dedicated detail page approach.

This document tracks the implementation of the new UI/UX design based on the `platform-outline.markdown`.

### Phase 2: Home Screen Implementation

**Objective:** Implement the new home screen design as outlined in the `platform-outline.markdown`.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Restructure Navigation Bar:** Update the navigation bar to include new links and a search bar. - **DONE**
2.  **Redesign Hero Section:** Implement a full-width hero section with an auto-playing video background, mood labels, and new call-to-action buttons. - **DONE**
3.  **Implement Sticky Mood Selector:** Add a sticky horizontal mood selector bar below the hero section. - **DONE**
4.  **Add Home Screen Functionality:** Implement the logic for the new mood selector and search bar. - **DONE**
5.  **Implement Scrolling Sections:** Add carousels for "Mood-matched picks," "Because you watched...," "Top 10," "Originals," and "Continue Watching." - **DONE**

### Phase 3: Detail Page Integration

**Objective:** Integrate a dedicated detail page (`detail.html`) for displaying movie/show information and handling video playback, replacing the previous modal approach.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Modify `app.js` for Redirection:** Update `createMovieCard` to redirect to `detail.html` with `imdbID` as a query parameter. - **DONE**
2.  **Remove Video Modal Logic from `app.js`:** Remove all DOM elements, functions, and event listeners related to the old video modal from `app.js`. - **DONE**
3.  **Implement `detail.html` Structure:** Create the basic HTML structure for the detail page, including sections for movie details, video player, and episode selection (for series). - **DONE**
4.  **Develop `detail.js`:** Create a new JavaScript file (`detail.js`) to handle fetching movie/show details, populating the `detail.html` page, and managing video playback from various sources. - **DONE**
5.  **Style `detail.html`:** Apply appropriate CSS (`detail.css`) to style the new detail page, ensuring consistency with the overall application design. - **DONE`

### Phase 4: Animations and Mobile Enhancements

**Objective:** Implement specific animation details and mobile-first design features as outlined in `platform-outline.markdown`.

**Tasks:**

1.  **General Transitions (Spring Easing Simulation):** Enhanced existing CSS transitions with `cubic-bezier` functions for a more springy feel. - **DONE**
2.  **"Add to List" Button Animation (Heart Pulse):** Implemented CSS keyframe animation for a pulse effect on hover. - **DONE**
3.  **Hero Banner "Ambient Video Background on Scroll":** Implemented JavaScript to create a dynamic opacity effect on the hero video background during scroll. - **DONE**
4.  **Loaders (Emoji Spinning Loader):** Replaced skeleton loaders with an emoji spinning loader. - **DONE**
5.  **Bottom Navigation:** Implemented a persistent bottom navigation bar for mobile viewports (HTML and CSS). - **DONE**
6.  **Mood Selector (Bottom Drawer):** Redesigned the mood selector for mobile as a bottom drawer with open/close functionality. - **DONE`
7.  **Swipe Carousel with Haptic Feedback:** Enhanced carousels to support swipe gestures for navigation and integrated haptic feedback. - **DONE`

### Phase 5: Visual Design Refinement and Consistency

**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive review and overhaul of the application's visual design and styling to ensure consistency, maintainability, and address specific UI bugs.

**Tasks:**

1.  **News Preview Bug Fix:** Modified `news.js` to include `article.description` in news cards and updated `news.css` to style the new description, resolving the news preview bug.
2.  **Centralized Design Tokens:** Introduced a comprehensive `:root` section in `style.css` to define CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, and transitions, establishing a consistent design system.
3.  **CSS File Alignment:** Updated `news.css`, `detail.css`, and `carousels.css` to utilize the newly defined CSS variables, ensuring all styling adheres to the new design tokens.
4.  **HTML Refactoring:** Removed inline `style="display: none;"` attributes from `index.html` sections and buttons.
5.  **JavaScript Refactoring:** Updated `app.js` to use `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()` with new `hidden-section` and `hidden-button` classes (defined in `style.css`) for managing element visibility, replacing direct `style.display` manipulations. This improves maintainability and aligns with modern CSS practices.

## News Section Integration (New)

### Objectives:
*   Integrate a dedicated news section into the application.
*   Display news articles related to movies and TV shows.
*   Provide a "Load More" functionality for news.

### Implementations:
*   **`news.html`:** Created a new HTML page for the news section.
*   **`news.css`:** Developed a dedicated CSS file for styling the news page.
*   **`news.js`:** Implemented JavaScript to:
    *   Fetch news articles from the `/api/fetch-news` endpoint.
    *   Render news articles in a grid layout.
    *   Handle "Load More" functionality to paginate news results.
*   **Navigation Link:** Added a "News" link to the main navigation bar in `index.html` and `detail.html`.

### Decisions & Rationale:
*   **Dedicated Page:** A separate page for news provides a better user experience for browsing articles, rather than embedding a small widget on the home page.
*   **Load More:** Improves performance by loading news articles incrementally.
*   **API Endpoint:** Utilizes the existing `/api/fetch-news` serverless function for fetching news data securely.

### UI/UX Overhaul

**Objective:** Enhance mobile-friendliness and overall visual consistency.

**Changes Made:**

*   Replaced responsive CSS media queries in `style.css` with improved rules for better mobile-friendliness.
*   Restructured the navbar, hero section, and movie grids to adapt gracefully to smaller screen sizes.
*   Refined padding, font sizes, and layout for a cleaner mobile experience.
