# Development Log

**Task:** Final Bug Fixes and Mood Recommendation Refactoring.
**Files:**
  - src/detail.html (modified)
  - src/app.js (modified)
**Tests:**
  - Manual: ✅ Verified by user.
**Changes:**
  - **Bug Fix (Detail Page):** Added `type="module"` to the script tag in `src/detail.html`. This fixed a critical error that prevented the detail page from loading any JavaScript or movie information.
  - **Refactor (Mood Recommendations):** Replaced the entire mood-based recommendation engine in `src/app.js`.
    - Removed the old, inefficient `findMoviesByGenre` function which caused performance issues and unreliable results.
    - Implemented a new `findMoviesByMood` function that uses curated, high-quality lists of titles for each mood, ensuring fast and relevant recommendations.
    - Cleaned up related unused code and event listeners for better maintainability.
**Next:** Application is stable. Awaiting final user confirmation.

**Task:** Full-stack Bug Fixing and UI/UX Overhaul.
**Files:**
  - src/app.js (modified)
  - style.css (modified)
  - .env (modified)
**Tests:**
  - Manual: ✅ Verified by user.
**Changes:**
  - **Bug Fix (Functionality):** Corrected search event listeners to call the efficient `renderSearchResults` function instead of the slow `searchAllMoviesUnified`. This resolved both the slow search performance and the bug where movie card clicks were unresponsive.
  - **Bug Fix (API):** Added the `GNEWS_API_KEY` to the `.env` file, fixing the 500 internal server error on the news API endpoint.
  - **Bug Fix (UI):** Implemented an `onerror` handler in `createMovieCard` to display a placeholder for broken movie poster images, preventing 404 errors and improving visual stability.
  - **UI/UX Overhaul:**
    - Replaced responsive CSS media queries in `style.css` with improved rules for better mobile-friendliness.
    - Restructured the navbar, hero section, and movie grids to adapt gracefully to smaller screen sizes.
    - Refined padding, font sizes, and layout for a cleaner mobile experience.
**Next:** Awaiting further user feedback. Application is now in a stable and functional state.
