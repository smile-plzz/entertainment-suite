### Codebase Refactoring and Alignment with Documentation

**Objective:** Clean up the codebase, resolve discrepancies with documentation, and improve maintainability.

**Changes Made:**

*   **File Structure Consolidation:**
    *   Moved `src/index.html` to project root `index.html`.
    *   Moved `src/style.css` to project root `style.css`.
    *   Deleted redundant `src/index.html` and `src/style.css`.
    *   Removed redundant `src/api/api` directory.
*   **Configuration Updates:**
    *   Updated `vercel.json` to reflect correct paths for `detail.html`, `detail.js`, and removed references to `src/movie-recommendations` files.
*   **`app.js` Refactoring:**
    *   Removed all video modal related DOM element declarations, functions (`openVideoModal`, `populateEpisodes`, `loadVideoForMovie`, `loadVideoForSelectedEpisode`, `closeVideoModal`, `handleModalTabKey`, `trapFocus`, `constructVideoUrl`), and associated event listeners.
    *   Corrected `createMovieCard` redirection path to `detail.html`.
    *   Corrected `config.json` fetch path to `config.json`.
    *   Removed unused `generalSearchInputMood`, `generalSearchBtnMood` declarations and their event listeners.
*   **Shared Utilities:**
    *   Created `src/utils/api.js` to centralize `api` object and `videoSources` array.
    *   Updated `app.js` and `detail.js` to import these shared utilities.
*   **`detail.js` Enhancements:**
    *   Implemented `trapFocus` function for modal accessibility.
*   **`news.js` Cleanup:**
    *   Removed unused `categoryButtons` declaration and event listeners (as `news.html` does not exist).
*   **`index.html` Enhancements:**
    *   Added carousel container `div` elements (`mood-matched-carousel`, `because-you-watched-carousel`, `top-10-carousel`, `originals-carousel`, `continue-watching-carousel`) to support `carousels.js` rendering.

### Deep Integration of Movie Recommendation and Now Showing into a single Entertainment Suite application.

**Objective:** Integrate the features of "Movie Recommendation Based on Mood" and "Now Showing" into a single, unified "Entertainment Suite" application for a more cohesive user experience.

**Changes Made:**

*   **Unified Frontend Structure:**
    *   Created a new `src/index.html` combining UI elements from both applications.
    *   Merged JavaScript logic into a central `src/app.js`.
    *   Consolidated CSS into a single `src/style.css`.
    *   Utilized `src/now-showing/detail.html` and `src/now-showing/detail.js` as the unified detail page.
*   **Removed Redundant Files:**
    *   Removed the now redundant `src/movie-recommendations/` and `src/now-showing/` directories.
*   **Configuration Updates:**
    *   Updated `vercel.json` to reflect the new unified structure.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Implemented and passed basic E2E tests (`scripts/e2e.sh`) for the integrated application.

### Project Combination: `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` and `NowShowing`

**Objective:** Combine the `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` and `NowShowing` projects into a single, cohesive application called `EntertainmentSuite`.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create a new directory** for the combined project.
2.  **Use `NowShowing` as the base** due to its more advanced features (backend, build process, etc.).
3.  **Integrate the mood-based recommendation feature** from `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` into the `NowShowing` UI.
4.  **Merge the stylesheets** to create a consistent look and feel.
5.  **Combine the JavaScript logic**, routing all API calls through the existing `omdb-proxy.js` for security.
6.  **Remove redundant files** like `movie-details.html`, as the `NowShowing` modal will handle this functionality.

**Execution:**

*   Created the `EntertainmentSuite` directory.
*   Copied the contents of the `NowShowing` project into `EntertainmentSuite`.
*   Merged the `index.html` files, adding the mood selector and recommendation grid to the main page.
*   Combined the `style.css` files, adapting the styles from `MovieRecommendationBasedOnMood` to fit the `NowShowing` design.
*   Merged the JavaScript files, integrating the mood-based recommendation logic into `app.js`.
*   Copied the `config.json` file to the `EntertainmentSuite` directory.

### Refactoring `app.js` for `detail.html` Integration

**Objective:** Prepare `app.js` to work with a dedicated `detail.html` page for movie/show details and video playback, removing old modal logic and simplifying the main application file.

**Changes Made:**

*   **Removed old DOM element declarations:** Eliminated elements related to the previous video modal, theme toggle, hamburger menu, and old navigation links.
*   **Removed UI functions:** Deleted `openVideoModal`, `populateEpisodes`, `loadVideoForMovie`, `loadVideoForSelectedEpisode`, `closeVideoModal`, `handleModalTabKey`, `trapFocus`, `constructVideoUrl`, and `findMoviesByMood` from the `ui` object.
*   **Removed associated event listeners:** Cleaned up event listeners that were tied to the removed DOM elements and functions.
*   **Updated `createMovieCard`:** Modified the function to redirect to `detail.html` with the `imdbID` as a query parameter when a movie card is clicked.
*   **Simplified `init` function:** Removed theme-related logic and the `moodGenreMapping` fetch, as these will be handled elsewhere or are no longer needed in `app.js`'s scope.

### Visual Design and Styling Overhaul

**Objective:** Enhance the overall visual design and consistency of the application, fix the news preview bug, and refactor styling for better maintainability.

**Changes Made:**

*   **News Preview Bug Fix:** Modified `news.js` to include `article.description` in news cards and updated `news.css` to style the new description, resolving the news preview bug.
*   **Centralized Design Tokens:** Introduced a comprehensive `:root` section in `style.css` to define CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, and transitions, establishing a consistent design system.
*   **CSS File Alignment:** Updated `news.css`, `detail.css`, and `carousels.css` to utilize the newly defined CSS variables, ensuring all styling adheres to the new design tokens.
*   **HTML Refactoring:** Removed inline `style="display: none;"` attributes from `index.html` sections and buttons.
*   **JavaScript Refactoring:** Updated `app.js` to use `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()` with new `hidden-section` and `hidden-button` classes (defined in `style.css`) for managing element visibility, replacing direct `style.display` manipulations. This improves maintainability and aligns with modern CSS practices.
